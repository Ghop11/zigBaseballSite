    <h1>Private Lesson FAQ</h1>
    <h3><strong>How long is a private lesson?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Private lessons for a single athlete run 45 minutes in length. Ziggy found that the typical 30 minute sessions
      that most facilities provide do not offer enough time for an instructor to properly explain each concept, drill or
      exercise. With a 45 minute session, athletes are afforded more time to develop a deep understanding of what is
      being taught.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>How much is a private lesson?</strong></h3>
    <p>
    Regular price for a single private lesson is $65. Many facilities charge a higher price for only a 30 minute
      session, even with less experienced instructors. Ziggy prides himself on offering the most value possible to his
      clients.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Do you offer lesson packages?</strong></h3>
    <p>
    Yes. Package deals are available for Ziggy’s 45 minute sessions. The more lessons you purchase up front, the greater
      the discount you will receive. Here are the current lesson package offerings:
    </p>
    <h8>Light Package – 3 Lessons- $185 (5% off regular price)</h8>
    <h8>Standard Package – 5 Lessons – $293 (10% off regular price)</h8>
    <h8>Elite Package – 10 Lessons – $553 (15% off regular price)</h8>


    <h3><strong>Do you offer lessons for multiple players?</strong></h3>
    <p>
    Yes. On the scheduling page you will see the option to book 45, 60, or 90 minute sessions. 60 minute sessions are
      recommended for groups of 2 or 3 players. A 90 minute session is sufficient for groups of 3 that want more
      individual instruction, or for groups of 4 or more.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>There are many instructors out there. Why should we choose you?</strong></h3>
    <p>
    Ziggy gives the same amount of attention and energy to every player he works with, from the first year tee-baller
      to the division-1 college player. His goal is simply to help as many baseball and softball players as he can, and
      spread the love of the game. His favorite part about his job is the “light bulb moment.” It’s that moment when
      something clicks for a player and you can see the excitement on their face.

Ziggy found that the typical 30 minute sessions\n      that most facilities provide do not offer enough time for an instructor to properly explain each concept, drill or\n      exercise. With a 45 minute session, athletes are afforded more time to develop a deep understanding of what is\n      being taught.\n    </p>\n    <h3><strong>How much is a private lesson?</strong></h3>\n    <p>\n    Regular price for a single private lesson is $65. Many facilities charge a higher price for only a 30 minute\n      session, even with less experienced instructors. Ziggy prides himself on offering the most value possible to his\n      clients.\n    </p>\n    <h3><strong>Do you offer lesson packages?</strong></h3>\n    <p>\n    Yes. Package deals are available for Ziggy’s 45 minute sessions. The more lessons you purchase up front, the greater\n      the discount you will receive. Here are the current lesson package offerings:\n    </p>\n    <h8>Light Package – 3 Lessons- $185 (5% off regular price)</h8>\n    <h8>Standard Package – 5 Lessons – $293 (10% off regular price)</h8>\n    <h8>Elite Package – 10 Lessons – $553 (15% off regular price)</h8>\n\n\n    <h3><strong>Do you offer lessons for multiple players?</strong></h3>\n    <p>\n    Yes. On the scheduling page you will see the option to book 45, 60, or 90 minute sessions. 60 minute sessions are\n      recommended for groups of 2 or 3 players. A 90 minute session is sufficient for groups of 3 that want more\n      individual instruction, or for groups of 4 or more.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3><strong>There are many instructors out there. Why should we choose you?</strong></h3>\n    <p>\n    Ziggy gives the same amount of attention and energy to every player he works with, from the first year tee-baller\n      to the division-1 college player. His goal is simply to help as many baseball and softball players as he can, and\n      spread the love of the game. His favorite part about his job is the “light bulb moment.” It’s that moment when\n      something clicks for a player and you can see the excitement on their face.\n    </p>\n\n  </v-container>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    export default {\n        name: \"FAQ.vue\"\n    }\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n\n</style>"]}]}
